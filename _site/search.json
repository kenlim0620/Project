Specifically, this project aims to:\n1. Explore Demographics & Behavior: Provide interactive visual tools to understand user profiles and transactional patterns.\n2. Predictive Risk Assessment: Implement statistical models to forecast churn probability and estimate CLV for individual customers based on dynamic inputs.\n3. Advanced Segmentation (RFM): Classify the customer base into actionable segments based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.\n4. Time-to-Event Analysis: Utilize Survival Analysis (Kaplan-Meier) to determine the exact tenure months where specific customer groups are at the highest risk of churning.\n5. Macro Cash Flow Mapping: Visualize the holistic ecosystem of funds entering and exiting the platform using Sankey network diagrams."

    "text": "4 4. Proposed Methodology & Analytical Approach\nTo achieve our objectives, the FinRetain platform will be segmented into six distinct analytical modules:\n\n4.1 4.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nUsing ggplot2 and plotly, we will analyze the demographic distribution of our user base, allowing filtering by Gender and Customer Segments to uncover baseline trends in Income and Education.\n\n\n4.2 4.2 Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)\nWe will implement interactive scatter plots with statistical trendlines to investigate correlations between behavioral variables (e.g., App Logins vs. Satisfaction Scores) and assess the volume breakdown of transaction types.\n\n\n4.3 4.3 Churn & CLV Risk Simulator\nWe will train multiple Linear Regression (lm) models to predict the probability of churn and estimate CLV. A dynamic UI simulator will allow users to adjust hypothetical customer parameters (Age, Transactions, Support Tickets) to see real-time shifts in risk metrics, alongside a DT datatable highlighting similar at-risk customers in the database.\n\n\n4.4 4.4 Survival Analysis\nUsing the survival and survminer packages, we will plot Kaplan-Meier Churn Probability Curves. This time-to-event analysis will allow stakeholders to compare the survival rates of different acquisition channels and income brackets over time.\n\n\n4.5 4.5 RFM Segmentation\nCustomers will be scored and categorized into segments (e.g., “Champions”, “Loyal Customers”, “Lost Risks”) based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics. A plotly Treemap will visualize the size and average CLV of each segment.\n\n\n4.6 4.6 Macro Cash Flow (Sankey Diagram)\nUsing the networkD3 library, we will map the directional flow of capital. The Sankey diagram will visualize how external funds (Incoming Transfers, Direct Deposits) pool into the app wallet and disperse into out-flows (Payments, Withdrawals)."

    "text": "The FinRetain interactive application has enabled us to move beyond static data and dynamically explore the lifecycle of our financial user base. By integrating exploratory visualizations with advanced predictive analytics, we uncovered critical insights into customer behavior, retention bottlenecks, and macroeconomic flow within the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur initial exploration using the demographic and behavioral modules revealed several foundational truths about our user base:\n\nIncome vs. App Engagement: Customers in the “High” and “Very High” income brackets exhibit significantly higher transaction frequencies, but they are also more sensitive to friction, showing a steep drop in Satisfaction Score when Support Tickets exceed a certain threshold.\nVolume Distribution: The transaction breakdown indicates that Direct Deposits are the primary driver of incoming liquidity, while Payments (rather than Cash Withdrawals) constitute the highest volume of outgoing capital.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Kaplan-Meier Churn Probability Curve, we plotted the exact tenure months where different customer segments are statistically most likely to abandon the app.\n\nThe Critical Drop-Off Window: We observed a steep drop in the survival probability curve between Month 3 and Month 6 across all acquisition channels. If a customer survives past Month 6, their probability of long-term retention increases exponentially.\nChannel Variance: Customers acquired via specific marketing channels showed inherently different survival trajectories, suggesting that the quality of onboarding greatly impacts long-term loyalty.\n\n\n\n\nThe dynamic RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Treemap allowed us to instantly categorize our entire database into actionable blocks:\n\nChampions & Loyalists: While making up a smaller physical percentage of the user base, the dark color mapping (indicating high Customer Lifetime Value) confirmed that this group drives the vast majority of future projected revenue.\nAt-Risk Segments: A surprisingly large block of users fell into the “Recent Users” with low Frequency scores. These users are at immediate risk of churning if not engaged quickly.\n\n\n\n\nThe network analysis of capital flow mapped exactly how money enters and leaves the FinRetain ecosystem.\n\nCapital Retention: By balancing the visual nodes (100% Inflow vs. 100% Outflow), we identified the exact proportion of incoming funds that are immediately drained via “Cash Withdrawals” versus funds that are kept within the ecosystem for “App Payments.”\nLiquidity Insights: The thickest flow lines originate from Direct Deposits, proving that convincing a user to set up direct payroll deposit is the single most valuable action the app can incentivize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the quantitative results derived from the FinRetain platform, our team proposes the following strategic business interventions:\n\n\nSince the Survival Analysis proved that Months 3 through 6 are the most dangerous for customer churn, the marketing team should automate targeted retention campaigns (e.g., fee waivers, premium feature trials) specifically triggered at the 90-day tenure mark.\n\n\n\nThe RFM Treemap highlighted a massive block of low-frequency “Recent Users.” We recommend using the Risk Simulator module to test how artificially increasing their app logins or transaction counts (via gamification or rewards) impacts their projected Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).\n\n\n\nThe Sankey Cash Flow diagram proved that Direct Deposits feed the most capital into the app ecosystem. Business development should focus on campaigns that reward users for switching their primary salary deposit to FinRetain, as this ensures long-term liquidity and highly active transactional behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FinRetain Visual Analytics platform successfully bridges the gap between raw data and executive decision-making. By leveraging R Shiny, survminer, and networkD3, we have provided stakeholders with an interactive environment to not only view historical data but to simulate and predict future customer behavior."

    "text": "To ensure the FinRetain Shiny application runs at lightning speed on the web, we intentionally decoupled the heavy data processing from the live application. Our data preparation pipeline cleans raw demographic and transactional data, performs advanced feature engineering, and exports a highly optimized .rds file. Below is the step-by-step methodology used to prepare the dataset.\n\n\n\nWe began by loading the raw simulated customer dataset. Categorical variables with intrinsic hierarchy needed to be properly factored so that visual plots (like bar charts) would display in a logical order, rather than alphabetically.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Load raw dataset\ndf &lt;- read.csv(\"customer_data.csv\")\n\n# Factor ordinal variables for logical plotting\ndf$income_bracket &lt;- factor(df$income_bracket, \n                            levels = c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\", \"Very High\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTo power our Advanced Analytics modules (Survival Analysis and RFM Treemap), we needed to dynamically generate new variables from the raw data.\n\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier survival curves require a definitive “event” (1 for occurred, 0 for censored). Since our raw data provided a continuous churn_probability, we established a strict threshold: customers with a probability &gt; 60% were flagged as a definitive churn event.\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    churn_event = ifelse(churn_probability &gt; 0.6, 1, 0)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calculated RFM scores by dividing the customer base into tertiles (using ntile()) across three key dimensions:\n\nRecency (R): Based on customer_tenure (proxy for how long they’ve stayed active).\nFrequency (F): Based on tx_count (Total Transactions).\nMonetary (M): Based on total_tx_volume (Total volume moved).\n\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    R_Score = ntile(customer_tenure, 3),\n    F_Score = ntile(tx_count, 3),\n    M_Score = ntile(total_tx_volume, 3)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the generated 1-3 scores, we applied conditional logic to segment the user base into actionable business categories:\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    RFM_Segment = case_when(\n      R_Score == 3 & F_Score == 3 & M_Score == 3 ~ \"Champions\",\n      R_Score &lt;= 2 & F_Score == 3 & M_Score == 3 ~ \"Loyal Customers\",\n      R_Score == 3 & F_Score &lt;= 2 ~ \"Recent Users\",\n      R_Score == 1 & F_Score == 1 & M_Score == 1 ~ \"Lost/Churned Risks\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Average Users\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the dataset was cleaned and enriched with our engineered features, we saved it as an R Data Serialization (.rds) file. This format preserves all R-specific attributes (like our factored income levels) and loads significantly faster in the Shiny Server environment than a standard CSV.\n\n\nCode\n# Export the final optimized dataset for Shiny\nsaveRDS(df, \"app_data.rds\")"
