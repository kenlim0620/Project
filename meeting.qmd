# Project Timeline

Below is the official record of team meetings, key decisions, and technical troubleshooting sessions conducted during the development of the FinRetain application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Meeting 1: Project Kickoff & Data Strategy

**Date:** 21/02/2026\
**Time:** 16:00 - 18:00\
**Location:** Campus Library\
**Attendees:** LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI

### 🎯 Agenda

1.  Define project scope and core analytical modules.
2.  Discuss data handling for the large `transactions_data` file.
3.  Assign initial roles.

### 🗣️ Key Discussions & Decisions

-   **Data Pipeline:** The team identified that the transaction dataset is too large to process live on a free `shinyapps.io` server.
-   ***Decision:*** We will build an offline data pipeline to aggregate the transaction types and join them with the customer demographics, saving the output as a highly compressed `app_data.rds` file for lightning-fast app loading.
-   **Core Modules:** Agreed to build an EDA Demographic tab, a CDA Behavioral tab, and a Churn/CLV Risk Simulator using Linear Regression models.

### ✅ Action Items

| Task | Assignee | Deadline | Status |
|----|----|----|----|
| Create offline data wrangling script (`dplyr`, `tidyr`) | LIN XIANWEI | 21/02/2026 | Completed |
| Build base UI shell using `bslib` | LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI | 25/02/2026 | Completed |
| Train `lm` predictive models for Simulator | LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI | 27/02/2026 | Completed |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Meeting 2: Advanced Analytics Integration

**Date:** 01/03/2026\
**Time:** 15:00 - 18:00\
**Location:** Via Zoom\
**Attendees:** LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI

### 🎯 Agenda

1.  Review the base Shiny app.
2.  Brainstorm unique insights to secure high marks for novelty and methodology.

### 🗣️ Key Discussions & Decisions

-   **Novelty Requirement:** Standard bar charts are insufficient for top marks. We need advanced financial analytics.
-   ***Decision 1 (Survival Analysis):*** We will implement Kaplan-Meier survival curves using the `survival` package to predict the exact tenure month customers are most likely to churn.
-   ***Decision 2 (RFM Segmentation):*** We will calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores on the fly and visualize them using a `plotly` Treemap.
-   ***Decision 3 (Cash Flow):*** We will implement a `networkD3` Sankey diagram to visualize macro fund flows.

### ✅ Action Items

| Task | Assignee | Deadline | Status |
|----|----|----|----|
| Write dynamic RFM calculation code in `app.R` | LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI | 03/03/2026 | Completed |
| Build Sankey Diagram logic | LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI | 09/03/2026 | Completed |
| Implement Kaplan-Meier plots | LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI | 14/03/2026 | Completed |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Meeting 3: Deployment & Bug Squashing

**Date:** 15/03/2026\
**Time:** 14:00 - 17:00\
**Location:** Via Zoom\
**Attendees:** LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI

### 🎯 Agenda

1.  Deploy the unified `app.R` to shinyapps.io.
2.  Troubleshoot server crashes and UI bugs.

### 🗣️ Key Discussions & Decisions

-   **Issue 1: Server Crash on Deployment (Exit Status 1).** The server crashed because it was looking for the raw CSV files which were excluded from the deployment folder.
    -   ***Fix:*** Stripped the offline data pipeline from the deployment version of `app.R` and loaded `app_data.rds` directly.
-   **Issue 2: Survival Plot Error (`object of type 'symbol' is not subsettable`).** The `ggsurvplot` function failed in the reactive Shiny environment.
    -   ***Fix:*** Replaced `survfit()` with `surv_fit()` and explicitly wrapped the plot in a `print()` command.
-   **Issue 3: Sankey Diagram Visual Imbalance.** The left side of the Sankey diagram was visually squashed because incoming funds were much smaller than outgoing volume.
    -   ***Fix:*** Decoupled the visual drawing weights from the actual dollar amounts. Forced balanced proportions (100% vs 100%) while formatting the text labels to still display the actual, accurate currency amounts (`$X,XXX,XXX`).

### ✅ Action Items

| Task | Assignee | Deadline | Status |
|----|----|----|----|
| Final code cleanup and commenting | LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI | 29/03/2026 | Completed |
| Deploy stable version to Shinyapps.io | LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI | 20/03/2026 | Completed |
| Write project proposal and Quarto site | LIN XIANWEI, SU HUI | 15/03/2026 | Completed |
