## 1. Introduction and Motivation

In the highly competitive financial technology (FinTech) and banking sector, customer retention is a critical driver of profitability. Acquiring a new customer is significantly more expensive than retaining an existing one. However, identifying exactly *when* and *why* a customer might abandon a financial platform (churn) remains a complex challenge due to the high-dimensional nature of transactional data.

**FinRetain** is designed to address this critical blind spot. It is an interactive visual analytics platform built to help financial analysts and product stakeholders dynamically explore customer demographics, track behavioral friction points, and proactively predict churn using advanced statistical modeling.

## 2. Project Objectives

Our primary goal is to build an interactive R Shiny application that transforms raw transactional and demographic data into actionable business intelligence. Specifically, this project aims to transition from descriptive reporting to proactive forecasting through:

1.  **Behavioral Exploration:** Provide interactive visual tools to understand user demographic profiles and identify friction points in the user experience.
2.  **Algorithmic Profiling (K-Means):** Autonomously group users into distinct behavioral personas based on transaction frequency and monetary volume.
3.  **Advanced Segmentation (RFM):** Classify the customer base into actionable business segments based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics.
4.  **Time-to-Event Analysis:** Utilize Survival Analysis to determine the exact tenure timeline where specific customer groups are at the highest risk of dropping off.
5.  **Macro Cash Flow Mapping:** Visualize the holistic ecosystem of liquidity entering and exiting the platform.
6.  **Predictive Risk Assessment:** Implement a dynamic simulator to forecast churn probability and estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on adjustable inputs.

## 3. Data Description

The dataset powering FinRetain contains historical records of customer accounts and transactional logs, encompassing:

-   **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Education Level, Income Bracket.
-   **Engagement Metrics:** App Logins, Support Tickets Logged, Satisfaction Score (1-5).
-   **Transactional Data:** Transaction counts, average transaction values, and aggregated volumes across various types (Deposits, Payments, Transfers, Withdrawals).
-   **Target Variables:** Customer Tenure (months), Churn Probability, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

## 4. Proposed Methodology & Analytical Approach

To achieve our objectives, the FinRetain platform will be engineered using R Shiny and segmented into six distinct analytical modules:

### 4.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Using `ggplot2` and `plotly`, we will analyze the demographic distribution of our user base. This module will allow stakeholders to filter by Gender and Customer Segments to uncover baseline trends in Income and Education.

### 4.2 Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)

We will implement interactive scatter plots with statistical trendlines to investigate behavioral hypotheses, specifically assessing the negative correlation between Support Tickets and overall App Satisfaction for high-volume users.

### 4.3 Behavioral Clustering

Using the K-Means clustering algorithm, we will identify hidden user personas. By plotting transaction frequency against total transaction volume, the platform will autonomously categorize users into distinct operational groups (e.g., High-Volume vs. High-Frequency users).

### 4.4 RFM Value Segmentation

Customers will be scored and categorized into segments (e.g., "Champions", "Loyal Customers", "At Risk") based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics. A dynamic `plotly` Treemap will visualize the size and hierarchy of each segment to prioritize marketing efforts.

### 4.5 Time-to-Event Survival Analysis

Using the `survival` package, we will plot Kaplan-Meier Churn Probability Curves. This module will act as a "ticking clock," allowing stakeholders to identify the critical 90-day drop-off window and compare survival rates across different user demographics.

### 4.6 Macro Cash Flow (Sankey Diagram)

Using the `networkD3` library, we will map the directional flow of capital. The Sankey diagram will visualize how external funds (Direct Deposits) pool into the app wallet and disperse into out-flows, quantifying the exact dollar amounts retained versus lost.

### 4.7 Churn & CLV Risk Simulator

We will train a Multiple Linear Regression (`lm`) model to predict the probability of churn. A dynamic UI simulator will allow users to adjust hypothetical customer parameters (e.g., simulating a reduction in support tickets) to see real-time shifts in risk metrics, visually forecasting a "saved" customer.

## 5. Proposed Deliverables

1.  **R Shiny Application:** A fully deployed, interactive web application hosted on shinyapps.io featuring a low-cognitive-load UI designed with `bslib`.
2.  **Project Report/Website:** A comprehensive Quarto document detailing the technical architecture, methodology, business findings, and user guide.
3.  **Source Code Repository:** A clean, well-commented GitHub repository containing the ETL data pipeline (`app_data.rds`) and application logic (`app.R`).
