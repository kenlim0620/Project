## 1. Motivation

The fishing industry in Oceanus is critical for the local economy... *\[Insert your elevator pitch here\]*... However, illegal fishing threatens this ecosystem. Current methods of detection are manual and slow.

**Why Visual Analytics?** By visualizing shipping networks and proximity data, we can detect anomalies that raw spreadsheets cannot reveal.

## 2. Objectives

Our project aims to build an interactive dashboard to:

1.  **Characterize** the temporal patterns of fishing vessels.
2.  **Detect** anomalies in shipping routes using trajectory analysis.
3.  **Identify** potential collusive networks between companies.
