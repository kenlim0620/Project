Brainstormed 3 potential topics: Illegal Fishing (Oceanus), Weather patterns, and Tourism. 2. Voted to proceed with [Your Chosen Topic] due to data availability.\nAction Items: - [x] Create GitHub Repository (Assigned to: Member A) - [x] Draft Project Proposal (Assigned to: Member B)\n\n\n🗓️ Week 2: Proposal Review\nDate: 21 January 2026\nAttendees: Member A, Member C\nAbsent: Member B (Medical Leave)\nKey Discussions: 1. Refined the “Motivation” section of the proposal. 2. Initial data cleaning revealed missing values in the 2024 dataset.\nDecisions: - We will focus on the years 2015-2023 to avoid data gaps. - The dashboard will use a “Scrollytelling” layout."
